      <p>If you're ever visiting Massapequa, New York, be sure to stop by Phil's Pizza. They don't just serve pizza. They also will make a nice salad with plenty of fresh basil and other good stuff. Don't take my word for it. Look at the pictures on their website. You will be unable to watch without getting hungry. Or, you can go <a href="index.html">back to the Home page</a>.</p>
