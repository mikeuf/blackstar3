        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p>The goal for this project was to create a brand identity for a tech startup.</p>

        <h3>Inspirations</h3>
        <p>The name and visual design are inspired by the mission of the client company. They build custom mobile apps for their customers. The logo is designed to resemble a new mobile app with a little “star” badge that appears in the corner of apps in some contexts.</p>

        <h3>Targeted Audience</h3>
        <p>The brand identity is designed to be attractive to small businesses who want to project a more professional and cohesive image, but aren’t sure where to start.</p>

        <h3>Skills/Techniques/Programs used</h3>
        <p>The logo, along with most of the project, were designed with Adobe Illustrator. The website mock-up was created with InDesign. The color scheme is intentionally low-contrast, giving a “flat” and modern appearance. I tried different color combinations, including higher contrast combinations. The flat “red and purple” scheme seemed to accomplish the objective of being striking and modern. I used as few colors as possible, trying to maintain consistency throughout the documents.</p>

        <p>The icons were actually created by a designer who goes by “Eucalypt,” whose work is available from flaticon.com. I simply changed the colors of the icon to match the theme.</p>

        <h3>Client Profile</h3>
        <p>The client is completely fictional. The identity is based on a brief description of a tech startup who wants to project a modern and professional image. “Automat” is named after a kind of fast food restaurant where the walls are filled with vending machine-like slots with ready-made meals. It’s not common in the USA anymore, but I think they are still found in other countries.</p>
