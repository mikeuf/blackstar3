        <h3>Requirements/Project’s Goals</h3>
        <p>
        The goal for this project was to create a brand identity for a tech startup.</p>

        Inspirations
        The name and visual design are inspired by the mission of the client company. They build custom mobile apps for their customers. The logo is designed to resemble a new mobile app with a little “star” badge that appears in the corner of apps in some contexts.

        Targeted Audience
        The brand identity is designed to be attractive to small businesses who want to project a more professional and cohesive image, but aren’t sure where to start.

        Skills/Techniques/Programs used
        The logo, along with most of the project, were designed with Adobe Illustrator. The website mock-up was created with InDesign. The color scheme is intentionally low-contrast, giving a “flat” and modern appearance. I tried different color combinations, including higher contrast combinations. The flat “red and purple” scheme seemed to accomplish the objective of being striking and modern. I used as few colors as possible, trying to maintain consistency throughout the documents.

        The icons were actually created by a designer who goes by “Eucalypt,” whose work is available from flaticon.com. I simply changed the colors of the icon to match the theme.

        Who was the client (and a brief description about them)?
        The client is completely fictional. The identity is based on a brief description of a tech startup who wants to project a modern and professional image. “Automat” is named after a kind of fast food restaurant where the walls are filled with vending machine-like slots with ready-made meals. It’s not common in the USA anymore, but I think they are still found in other countries.
