      <h1>A Tribute to Pizza</h1>

      <h2>Welcome to the Cathedral of Pizza</h2>
      <p>Pizza will make you rich. Pizza will give you the strength to lift a washing machine over your head and hurl it through your neighbor's window. Pizza will give you the ability to swim with the grace of a dolphin and run faster than a horse on amphetamines. Pizza will give you the courage of ten thousand drunk lions. Pizza will make your enemies flee before you, or fall to their knees. I insist that you eat pizza at every opportunity.<br />
