        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Welcome to ACME Ferris Wheels, Inc. We build the sturdiest and prettiest ferris wheels east of the Mississippi. We also sell <a href="https://www.duplay.co.uk/large-12ft-turret-bouncy-castle-with-slide-9017.html" target="_blank">bouncy castles</a> and steak knives. We are perhaps best known for selling the ferris wheel that was ridden by <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/falwell2.jpg" target="_blank">Jerry Falwell</a> at the Chicago World's Fair. OK, he was actually riding a water slide, but he did once ride one of our ferris wheels. We promise! </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our operators are standing by, just waiting for you to call. Please call us as soon as possible. The ferris wheel market is not exactly booming at the moment. In fact, we haven't sold a single ferris wheel since the Gerald Ford Administration. Kids think ferris wheels are corny and would rather play XBOX. But you're old enough to have refined tastes. And you'll love our ferris wheels. We promise!</p>
