      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <section>
        <p>I recently worked in Heathrow, Florida, as a Knowledge Engineer for a software company called Veritas Technologies. In addition to my primary role of authoring, editing, and curating technical articles for our knowledgebase and website, I had the opportunity to represent our group in the role of the agile product owner, writing user stories and working with stakeholders to define the business requirements and acceptance criteria for our website, search engines, and KM (Knowledge Management) system. I also participated in acceptance testing (UAT) and post-production validation (PPV).

        <p>I completed a BA in Computer Science at Florida State University (FSU) in 2015 and am a current graduate student at University of Florida, working towards a master's degree in Mass Communication with a concentration in Web Design and Online Communication. This program combines Web Design, graphics design, and some traditional academic communication courses. It seems like a perfect way to build on the technical foundation that I gained while completing my undergraduate degree.</p>
        <p>Between work and school, I haven't had much of a life, lately. I do enjoy listening to, and writing, music. If I'm feeling ambitious, I also enjoy cooking. I'm awful at both, but I still have fun. I like to jog. Unfortunately, I also like to eat. Maybe that's why I have the physique of Larry the Cable Guy, despite all the cardio.</p>
        <p>If you're curious, this website is running on Nginx and Node.js. Digital Ocean currently hosts it. If something's broken, it's probably their fault. I'm only half joking.</p>

        <p>Thanks for visiting. Stay for as long as you like and enjoy the hors d'oevres!</p>
