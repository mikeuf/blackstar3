          <h1>About Me</h1>
        <section>
          <p>I work in Heathrow, Florida, as a "Knowledge Engineer" for a software company called Veritas Technologies. This is a fancy title for a hybrid role that combines technical writing, web design, a bit of software development, and occasional technical support. I enjoy projects that allow me to combine low-level, technical, skills with creative inspiration. Of course, that could mean just about anything these days, from a full stack developer to a rock star.</p>

          <p>I completed a BA in Computer Science at Florida State University (FSU) in 2015 and am a current graduate student at University of Florida, working towards a master's degree in Mass Communication with a concentration in Web Design and Online Communication. This program combines Web Design, graphics design, and some traditional academic communication courses. It seems like a perfect way to build on the technical foundation that I gained while completing my undergraduate degree. I also hope to polish my writing skills and learn more about the emerging technologies and strategies that are being used to reach new audiences.</p>
          <p>Between my day job and classes, I'm quite busy and don't have much of a life outside of work and school. I do enjoy listening to, and writing, music. If I'm feeling ambitious, I also enjoy cooking. I'm awful at both, but I still have fun. I like to jog. Unfortunately, I also like to eat. Maybe that's why I have the physique of Larry the Cable Guy, despite all the cardio.</p>
          <p>If you're curious, this website is running on Nginx and Node.js. Digital Ocean currently hosts it. If something's broken, it's probably their fault. I'm only half joking.</p>

          <p>Thanks for visiting. Stay for as long as you like and enjoy the hors d'oevres!</p>
