<strong>Purpose:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>
Increase visits to the Daytona State College (DSC) website by 10 percent</li>
<li>Increase applications to DSC by 3 percent</li> 
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Background:</strong><br />
Like many Florida colleges, DSC has experienced a recent decline in enrollment as the unemployment rate has dropped<sup>1</sup>. To halt, or even reverse this decline,  DSC will implement an online marketing campaign that is designed to reach both traditional, and non-traditional, students and inform them of the benefits of the many educational programs that are available.<br />
<br />
1. Martin, A. (2014, March 26). Daytona State cuts 22 employees due to declining enrollment. Retrieved November 26, 2014, from http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20140326/NEWS/140329547<br /><br />
<strong>Target Audiences:</strong><br />
<ul>
<li> Traditional, prospective students (age 17-24) and their parents</li>
<li> Non-traditional, prospective students (age 25, and over)</li>
<li> Local workers who are technically-savvy, but lack formal degrees</li>
<li> News media, especially US News &amp; World Report</li>
<li> High school guidance counselors</li>
<li> Government &amp; regulatory figures, such as SACS (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) and the US Department of Education</li>

</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col">Use Google Adwords to increase awareness among non-traditional students who are outside of the Central Florida area</div>
<div class="col">Purchase Google AdWords campaign that targets common keywords for online degrees, such as "online degree" or "accredited online degree." This would reach potential students outside of driving distance to DSC, so the ads would need to emphasize online degrees and route vistors to the DSC online degree landing page instead of the main page. This method can be used to reach valuable international students.</div>
<div class="col">Can be very expensive. Cost-per-click (CPC) can vary widely. Research suggests that CPCs average $0.50-$1.00 but online degree-related keywords can be extremely expensive, with CPCs of $50.00, and up. At the high end, it's probably not worth the cost.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col">Use Facebook Ads to increase awareness among non-traditional students</div>
<div class="col">Use Facebook's demographic filtering to display DSC ads to people aged 25-35. My personal experience with online courses is that this is the most common age-range for online students.</div>
<div class="col">Research on the topic suggests that Facebook may have a lower CPC than Google, but it has been increasing. Anywhere from $0.40-$2.00 CPC should be expected. The ability to target based on demographics and interests instead of keyworks may make Facebook more cost effective since Google keywords like "online degree" have become prohibitively expensive.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col">Increase word-of-mouth advertising from area High School guidance counselors. This will drive enrollment from traditional students.</div>
<div class="col">Print brochures containing key facts about DSC, such as low-tuition, bachelors degrees, dual-enrollment programs and high online school ranking. Mail brochures directly to guidance counselors in area high schools.</div>
<div class="col">Under $100 to print 500 full-color brochures. Professional design costs could add $500-1000</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col">Use recruiters to increase awareness about DSC among the Unemployed</div>
<div class="col">Hire a recruitor to visit key public locations where unemployed people may frequent, such as unemployment centers or job fairs to set up a card table and answer questions about DSCs programs</div>
<div class="col">Under $100 to print 500 full-color brochures. Recruitors can probably be paid $10-15 per hour, or even a partially commission-based compensation structure. Giving away free "goodies," such as snacks, coffee or custom-branded pens or pads, etc., is an effective way to attract visitors. But this increases costs. A set of 250 custom-branded, promotional pens can cost around $200.</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col">Use strategically-placed brochures and flyers to increase awareness about DSC among local service industry workers</div>
<div class="col">Offer extra credit to students to receive and place flyers or brochures in strategic locations at their workplaces, such as break rooms, cafeterias and bathrooms. Local call-centers like Convergys and Symantec have hundreds of technically-savvy employees in the area who tend to lack college degrees and currently have greater awareness of Seminole State College than they do about DSC </div>
<div class="col">Under $100 to print 500 full-color brochures. Under $100 to print 1000 flyers</div>
